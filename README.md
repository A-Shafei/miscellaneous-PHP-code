# miscellaneous-PHP-code
Small messy PHP experiments

All made as part of coursework for various online courses.

Really basic stuff and not the prettiest or closest to best practice.

Would not have uploaded them hadn't the Instabug application asked for a GitHub account. Scavenged for old files or files I got clearance to upload.
