      <h1>Web Release vTEST</h1>
      <p>Released on 13th of March, here's what this release has changed:</p>

      <ol class="topic">
        <li>A major new feature is here! Called the Unlimited Listings Package; users will, soon, be able to buy a new package that lasts a limited time; that, while active, would allow them to add a limited number of listings everyday without deducting from their credit!</li>
        <img src="/home/shafey/temp_aqar/UnlimitedListingsProper.png">
        <li class="topic">Changed the way we sort the trending questions in the Questions page (that's https://egypt.aqarmap.com/en/question/). We now value how new the question is, in addition to how many answers it has.</li>
        <img src="/home/shafey/temp_aqar/TrendingQuestions.png">
        <li class="topic">Fixed an issue with users getting an email that their listings have been approved, while the listings are still pending photos and haven't been reviewed by an admin.</li>
      </ol>
